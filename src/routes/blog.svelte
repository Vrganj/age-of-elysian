<h2>Dev Diary #18 - Electric Vanilla Composter</h2>

			We noticed that many people are using composters to recycle extra plants from Harvesters, as
			well as saplings and leaves from Woodcutters. Unfortunately, cargo doesn't really work
			directly with composters, as they don't have an inventory. This led to people having to place
			hoppers above and below the composters, which is pretty space-inefficient and slow (and
			hoppers are kind of a lag source).
		</p>
		<p>
			So, we've added an electric machine that does what the vanilla composter does, but faster and,
			at the higher levels, better.

<h2>Dev Diary #17 - Some Polish</h2>

<p>
	This week we did a little tweaking with some animations and visuals. For one, Bonfires now have a
	passive and a teleportation animation to make them stand out more. They also have some new sounds.
</p>

<p>
	Crate animations also have been overhauled. Before, the dropped items would be dropped randomly
	around the chest in a single stack, which didn't look very interesting and was kind of annoying to
	grab if it happened to land behind the crate. Now, items are spit out individually which looks
	quite a bit better, and they are thrown in the player's direction so they are all easy to grab.
