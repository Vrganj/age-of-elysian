			Slimefun can be confusing at times. All those dusts and ingots that look the same... Crafting
			even the medium-tier items can get very difficult and time cosuming, and may ruin your playing
			experience. That's where our special, carefully made resource pack comes into play. With
			custom textures for every single dust and ingot there is, crafting will never be easier! The
			texture pack is being actively updated and worked on by our staff. It is free for download, so
