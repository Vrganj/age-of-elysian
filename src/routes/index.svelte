		<p style="text-align: justify">
			Age of Elysian is a server that has been in business for more than half a decade, and we've
			amassed quite a community during that time. Most player-suggested features have found their
			way to the server, and nowadays we are likely to be the most feature-packed cracked
			Slimefun-Towny server with rpg elements, with an up-to-date slimefun.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify">
			We are currently in a state of an Open Beta, so some bugs may be present. Don't worry though,
			our staff team is working hard to iron out any potential issues, so your playing experience
			isn't impaired. The server is un-modded, but client modifications like optifine are
			encouraged.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify">
			The server is cracked, so everyone is free to join. Unlike some other cracked servers,
			however, we host an experienced team of staff well aware of the risks of running an
			offline-mode server, and are more than capable with dealing with anything the script-kiddies
			have thrown at us so far. There is always somebody online to help you with any issues and
			answer all your questions.
