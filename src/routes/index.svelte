		<p style="text-align: justify">
			Age of Elysian is a server that has been in business for more than half a decade, and we've
			amassed quite a community during that time. Most player-suggested features have found their
			way to the server, and nowadays we are likely to be the most feature-packed cracked
			Slimefun-Towny server with rpg elements, with an up-to-date slimefun.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify">
			We are currently in a state of an Open Beta, so some bugs may be present. Don't worry though,
			our staff team is working hard to iron out any potential issues, so your playing experience
			isn't impaired. The server is un-modded, but client modifications like optifine are
			encouraged.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify">
			The server is cracked, so everyone is free to join. Unlike some other cracked servers,
			however, we host an experienced team of staff well aware of the risks of running an
			offline-mode server, and are more than capable with dealing with anything the script-kiddies
			have thrown at us so far. There is always somebody online to help you with any issues and
			answer all your questions.

		<p style="text-align: justify" class="mb-1">
			Slimefun is a plugin which aims to basically turn your Bukkit Server into a modpack like
			FeedTheBeast, IndustrialCraft2 or Tekkit without installing a single mod. It offers everything
			you could possibly imagine. From Backpacks to Jetpacks... It introduces a way of automating
			almost every task there is. We also have a couple of Slimefun addons, such as:
		</p>
		<ul style="padding-left: 1rem">
			<li>
				<b>Exotic Garden</b> which adds tons of new food types and ways of growing precious ores
			</li>
			<li><b>ExtraGear</b> that adds new and improved armor and tools</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Also, we have a custom made slimefun-specific resource pack, that makes crafting much easier
			and generally improves its visuals. For more information about how to download and install the
			resource pack, check out the <a href="/resource-pack">resource pack</a> page.

		<h1 class="text-center mb-3">Towny</h1>
		<p style="text-align: justify">
			Towny is a plugin that introduces a way of creating towns with grid-like land protection and
			an intricate permission system. Each town has a mayor, and each nation has a king. They both
			have their own assistants, builders and other town staff to help manage their respective
			people. Players can also purchase land from the town, As well as pay an optional daily tax set
			by the mayor. The player can allow his friends from out of town to build on his land when even
			his very own town's residents can't build if he so wishes, anything is possible.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify">
			The basis of protecting and claiming land is based on chunks. The whole world is split into
			16x16 sections of blocks, and each one is claimable by a town. Each town can claim up to a
			certain amount of townblocks, that scales with the town rank. Town ranks change with your town
			population growing. For example, a town with 2 members is considered a Hamlet, while a town
			with 30 members will be called a Metropolis. The more people you have, the more land you can
			claim!
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify">
			But beware: there is a town upkeep, that every town must pay daily. Each chunk costs a certain
			amount of money for it to be claimed for a day. Fail to pay the upkeep, and your town will be
			disbanded.
